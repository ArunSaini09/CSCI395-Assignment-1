                    A king cobra the length of a stretch limo slides through a field. 
                    Looking for food, it raises its head and flicks its tongue. 
                    Suddenly, a rat scampers past. The snake takes off after the rodent.
                    As it nears its prey, the cobra strikes: It sinks its venom-filled fangs 
                    into the rat to knock it out, then swallows the snack in one gulp.
                    King cobras are venomous snakes that live in South and Southeast Asia. 
                    The reptile makes its home in forests and swamps. 
                    It can grow up to 18 feet long. And the animal's toxic bite is powerful enough to kill an elephant.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When facing predators, king cobras try to act like tough guys. 
                    They often expand ribs and muscles on both sides of their necks to 
                    create what is called a hood. The hood makes the snake appear extra-big.

                <p>
                    King cobras never stop growing and shed their skin around 5 times a year!
