                    The males are called peacocks, while the females are called peahens. Together, they are peafowl.

                    Peafowl are among the largest of all birds that fly. (Ostriches, emus, and other such birds are bigger, 
                    but cannot fly.) The beautiful feathers that cover the tails of a peacock are 5 feet (1.5 meters) long—longer 
                    than the bird's body—and can be displayed in a spectacular fan of brilliant colors. These long feathers actually 
                    grow from the bird's back not the tail. He elevates them by raising the much shorter tail feathers underneath them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Peahens are more drab than their male counterparts, with mostly brown on their back with a white belly. 
                    Females don't have long tail feathers, but they do have a crest on their head and green neck feathers.
                    Indian peafowl are native to India and Sri Lanka, in South Asia. They've been introduced to other countries, 
                    usually as exhibits in parks, zoos, and nature centers or as domestic pets. The head and body of adult peafowl 
                    range from 3 to 4 feet long and their tail can be 5 feet long.
